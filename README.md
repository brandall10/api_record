Example code for my blog post: [ActiveRecord: Automatically Marshall an API Response](http://www.beaucodes.com/api-record)

To run

1. clone project
2. bundle install
3. rake

Note that there are no models used in this project as it uses the [temping gem](https://github.com/jpignata/temping) to create a table on the fly for testing.
